# Tasks

1. Go to the planets page ('/planets') and notice that only the first page of results is being rendere.
   Fix it so the remaining pages of results are rendered.
1. Notice the hooks on the list pages. Refactor them to use a custom hook.
   Use the custom hook on each of the list pages.
1. Add a form to the bottom of the people detail page ('/people/1') that allows the user to update name, height,
   mass and eye-color. Feel free to use whatever form libraries you like, for example formik.
   (Note: The people endpoint only supports the PATCH verb)

# Extra credit

Add a slide in/out transition for the content when the user changes the selected section.

# Delivery

When you're finished and want to submit your work. Run `yarn build` to create a delivery archive.
Then email the `delivery.zip` archive to your contact at Rightway Healthcare.

May the force be with you!
